# Arduino_Project01
A simple two digit digital thermometer using LM35 and Arduino UNO R3 board.

Here, I use following component...
 1. Arduino Uno Board.
 2. Bread board.
 3. LM35 temperature sensor.
 4. 7 Segment Display (Common Cathode)

In this experiment I use four seven segment displays, which of two are used to indicate degree celisus.

In this experiment I have used simple logic, There are many other ways you can do the same. If there are any wrong portions, please notify me! I am just a beginner in arduino.
